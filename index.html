                        <p>
                            As a developer, my responsibilities included modifying existing features and adding new
                            functionality to a multi-tenant web application using Laravel and Tailwind CSS. I worked
                            closely with the rest of the development team to ensure that all changes were properly
                            implemented and tested, and that they met the requirements of the project. Additionally, I
                            also ensured that the application was scalable and performant, and that any issues or bugs
                            were promptly addressed. Overall, the goal was to build a robust and user-friendly web
                            application for the end-users.

                        <p>
                            As a developer, my responsibilities included creating a web application for a Japanese
                            client that specializes in creating customized documents and PDFs based on user inputs and
                            applied conditions. The web application was to be used in conjunction with several other
                            applications, so I also created REST API's that would allow for seamless integration.
                            Additionally, I was in charge of both the production server and the database, which were
                            deployed on the Amazon AWS platform and accessed via SSH.

                            To build the web application, I utilized the Laravel framework and the JQuery library.
                            Laravel is a popular PHP framework that provides a simple and elegant syntax for creating
                            web applications, and JQuery is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to create dynamic
                            user interfaces. The combination of these two technologies allowed me to build a powerful
                            and user-friendly web application that met the client's requirements.

                        <p>
                            As a developer, I was also responsible for data visualization, debugging and
                            changing/modifying designs based on quality assurance (QA) standards. This involved creating
                            charts, graphs, and other visual aids to help users understand and analyze the data in the
                            application. I was also responsible for creating cronjobs to schedule automated tasks and
                            SQL queries to retrieve data from the database. Additionally, I was responsible for creating
                            data calculations based on the Amazon MWS API, which allowed the application to interact
                            with Amazon's Marketplace Web Service.

                            To build the web application, I utilized Laravel and jQuery as the primary frameworks and
                            Git for version control. Laravel is a popular PHP framework that provides a simple and
                            elegant syntax for creating web applications, and jQuery is a JavaScript library that makes
                            it easy to create dynamic user interfaces. Git is a distributed version control system that
                            allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously and keep track of
                            changes. Using these technologies allowed me to build a powerful and user-friendly web
                            application that met the client's requirements.

                            I was also responsible for troubleshooting and debugging any issues that arose during the
                            development process, and working with the other members of the development team to ensure
                            that the application met the client's needs and was of high quality. This included working
                            closely with QA team to ensure that the application met all the necessary standards and
                            testing the application thoroughly before releasing it to the client.

                            API into a web application and using it to access user data such as fitness information and
                            activity data. I had to make sure that the integration was done in a secure and efficient
                            manner, and that the data was properly displayed to the user. I also had to troubleshoot any
                            issues that arose and ensure that the application was up-to-date with the latest features
                            and functionalities provided by the GoogleFit API. Overall, my role was to ensure that the
                            web application was able to access the user's fitness data and provide useful insights and

                            access the application's functionality from their mobile devices. I was in charge of the
                            staging and production servers and the databases deployed on the AWS EC2 platform, and I
                            used Python, Selenium and cronjobs to automatically populate the database with the latest
                            data from reliable sources. My experience covers both front-end and back-end development,
                            and I utilized popular web development frameworks such as Laravel and Vue.js, as well as
